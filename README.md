## Notes

* For getting complete SAS dataset information, you must install the SAS OleDb Driver, available for free from SAS Institute. This feature only works on Windows.
* Active Directory lookups are partially in place. If you wish to use, work with Savian to test since I don't have an AD server
* Theming is not supported at this time but will be later.
* The application has been tested on Windows PCs and not smaller devices.
* Cells that contain any formatting, such as %, are displayed in a raw format when exported. 
  There is not general fix for this issue at this time.

## Future Enhancements

* Additional analysis including graphs
* Themes
* Ways to interpret the values
* Graphs
* Cap lifts
* More export options beyond Excel (ex. PDF, HTML, CSV)
